### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, specifically part 2 was interesting to me as I learned how to    differentiate between strings that are given to find the score of cards. Although not overly complicated, it expanded my knowledge of what could be done as I did not know that strings could be compared in that manner. Also learning how to play blackjack was quite fun and a nice addition to this lab.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, both parts were interesting but part 2 was better due to its complexity. I found it more difficult yet fun to handle the restrictions of parking at certain times. Trying to combine multiple time rules in my code was a challenging aspect that I overcame with my partner and overall was enjoyable. It was also the first time in used the && and || operators so much and I learned how to use them quite effectively.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, both part 1 and 2 taught me a good use of code, to do tasks that would normally take a lot of effort instead being quickly done due to the preparation done in the code. To make sure the code is correct in both parts, there were unit tests that tested so many possible variations of strings and numbers and it interests me that code can handle such a volume of work so fast. It also taught me how to traverse 2D vectors efficiently.
